### Task Rabbit
Heres another project I made with a group of four. Userbased app, where you could make tasks for other users to take on complete. There is also a ranking system, so other users could give stars depenging how you succeed with the tasks.      
Technologies used: Java(Spring boot), AWS(RDS), MySQL, React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, Mui       
Unfortunately the database was on cloud, so it would be quite hard to run it locally. But if you want to take a look of the code, repo can be found here:
